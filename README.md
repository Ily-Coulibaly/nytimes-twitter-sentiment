# NYTimes Articles vs. Public Comments Sentiment Analysis

## About

Ever wonder if news articles on a specific topic aligns with how people really feel about actual topic ? This project digs into that question by analyzing the emotional language gap between professional journalism and public reactions.

Using NLP and emotion detection, this analysis compares how The New York Times covers drone stories versus how readers respond in the comments section by:

- Fetching and analyzing 50 drone-related articles from The New York Times
- Collecting 6,018 public comments from 22 articles with active discussions
- Performing sentiment analysis and emotion detection on both datasets
- Comparing how media frames drone issues versus public reactions

**Key Finding**: Public comments show 2.7x higher emotional intensity than articles, with fear dominating both datasets.

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/drone-sentiment-analysis.git
cd drone-sentiment-analysis
```

2. Install required dependencies:
```bash
pip install pynytimes
pip install nytimes-scraper
pip install text2emotion
pip install pandas matplotlib
pip install nltk
pip install emoji==1.6.3
```

3. Download NLTK data:

nltk.download('punkt')
nltk.download('wordnet')
```

4. Get a New York Times API key:

   - Create an account and generate an API key
   - Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` in the notebook with your actual key
  
5. Run your own analysis

```python
# Open the main notebook
jupyter notebook _NYTDronesAnalysisIly.ipynb

# Or run programmatically
from pynytimes import NYTAPI
import text2emotion as te
import pandas as pd

# Initialize API and fetch data
nyt = NYTAPI("YOUR_API_KEY", parse_dates=True)
articles = nyt.article_search(query="drones", results=50)

# Run emotion analysis
df_articles['emotions'] = df_articles['text'].apply(lambda x: te.get_emotion(x))
df_comments['emotions'] = df_comments['text'].apply(lambda x: te.get_emotion(x))

# Generate comparison
results = compare_sentiment(df_articles, df_comments)
print(f"Media vs Public Fear Level: {results['fear_ratio']:.1f}x difference")
```

**Expected Output:**
```
